# leviath-core

Core types and traits for Leviath: context regions and memory layouts, token
budgets, blueprint manifests, tool and network policy, sandbox configuration,
and lifecycle rules. Every other crate in the runtime builds on this one.

Part of [Leviath](https://github.com/GEMISIS/leviath), a structured
agent runtime for LLMs. Most applications should depend on the
[`leviath`](https://crates.io/crates/leviath) facade crate rather than this
one, and if you want the `lev` command-line tool, install
[`leviath-cli`](https://crates.io/crates/leviath-cli).
