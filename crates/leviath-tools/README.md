# leviath-tools

The native tools Leviath agents can call: shell, file reads and writes, web
fetch and search, and the ask-user interaction tools, all gated by the
policy and sandbox types from leviath-core.

Part of [Leviath](https://github.com/GEMISIS/leviath), a structured
agent runtime for LLMs. Most applications should depend on the
[`leviath`](https://crates.io/crates/leviath) facade crate rather than this
one, and if you want the `lev` command-line tool, install
[`leviath-cli`](https://crates.io/crates/leviath-cli).
