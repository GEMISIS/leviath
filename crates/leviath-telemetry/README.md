# leviath-telemetry

OpenTelemetry export for Leviath's telemetry event stream. Traces, metrics,
and logs go out as OTLP over HTTP.

Part of [Leviath](https://github.com/GEMISIS/leviath), a structured
agent runtime for LLMs. Most applications should depend on the
[`leviath`](https://crates.io/crates/leviath) facade crate rather than this
one, and if you want the `lev` command-line tool, install
[`leviath-cli`](https://crates.io/crates/leviath-cli).
